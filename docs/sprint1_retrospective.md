- **Performance**: Dashboard loads slowly with large dataset

## What Worked Well üëç
- Streamlit rapid prototyping
- Clean project structure
- Git workflow established

## Improvements for Sprint 2 üéØ
- Implement ML-based fraud prediction
- Add data balancing techniques (SMOTE)
- Optimize dashboard performance with caching
- Add more interactive visualizations
